In regards to our conversation, here is the first of a couple upserts requested. We have a new selling agreement so we want to add them to our CRM.

Small data load is attached.
This is the first, and smallest data upsert requested from our team.
Please add two of the contacts (sample size), and then send me their names so our sales team can look up the ones you upserted and tell us if we added correctly. I believe they need to be added at the office level. If “office level” doesn’t make sense, let me know so we can confirm how the hierarchy should look, post the upsert.
I received many errors in the data import wizard where the mapping continuously failed. I can take screenshots, but essentially, the name didn’t match or couldn’t load or I didn’t have something mapped correctly. I have no idea.
These should be added with Jeff Medina (or Chad Wickliffe) as the Owner (Eastern Territory)
 

Let me know the expense and ETA for this.
